git ease
=======

git ease is my personal git automation linux shell script. <br>
This script makes the use of git easier.

# Why This ?
Looking to make adding, commiting and pushing in git so easy when working with a lot of tasks.<br>
Still working on making this as simple as working with just a word.<br>
Look through, If you love the idea, work on it too.<br>
Funny thing<br>
