# squasher
Squasher is simply an automation script that makes life with git easier.

### What it does?
Squasher is going to make you squash up all your git commands into a short line command.
When working on a project with a bunch of files, squasher will make it easy to do all that you want to do in just a single line.

# why this ?
Looking to make adding, commiting, pushing and time traveling in git so easy when working with a lot of tasks.
Still working on making this as simple as working with just a word.
Look through, If you love the idea, work on it too.
